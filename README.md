# GreptimeDB Community

We're thrilled to have you as a part of our community! Our mission is to build a modern hybrid time series & analytical database. Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or simply someone who's passionate about open source, there's a place for you in our community.

This is a guide to help you get started with our community. Please take a moment to read through this document and familiarize yourself with our code of conduct, contributing guidelines, and other resources.

We encourage you to get involved, share your ideas, and help us build a vibrant and inclusive community.

## Governance
Given that GreptimeDB is still in its early stages of development, we have not yet implemented a governance system akin to that of the Kubernetes Community. For now, we are maintaining a single official group on Slack.

* **Contributor Group** is a place where developers and contributors can communicate through text meetings, bi-weekly office hours, questionnaires, meetups, and more. We hope this group can promote collaborations and exchange ideas between our team of developers and contributors who are interested in building an amazing TSDB together! 
The discussion will cover various topics, including:
  * Gathering new requirements
  * Discussing issues with GreptimeDB products
  * Sharing technical knowledge
  * Announcing the latest releases and private previews
  * Demostrating new features
  * Responding to any questions
  * And more...

To foster a respectful and inclusive community, as well as enhancing communication, we hope that every member can adhere to the guidelines and etiquette of our group discussions:

1. **Don’t add someone to a channel without letting them know**: A contributor is defined as someone who has contributed to Greptime GitHub projects. Only Greptime team members can invite a contributor to the Contributor Channel. To avoid confusion, let someone know that you’ll be adding them to a channel and clarify their responsibilities beforehand.

2. **Be careful with @channel or @everyone all the time**: When you @channel, everyone who is in the channel will get a notification. With @everyone, all members of the general channel will be notified. You can prevent misunderstandings and confusion by only @mentioning or DM the people who need to see your message.

3. **Do write to be understood**: Please try your best to write out your entire point within one message, use direct, succinct language, or bullet points and numbers for the additional organization given the asynchronous nature of Slack.

4. **Use threads to maintain conversation flow**: We encourage you to reply directly to topics and messages that pertain to you by using Slack threads. Replying within a thread declutters the channel and helps maintain control of the workspace.

5. **Customize your Slack notifications**: Since we have contributors located in different timezones, we respect everyone's work style. If you prefer not to be disturbed, kindly update your status to reflect this, or clearly indicate your working hours so that others are aware.

Once you have made a contribution to GreptimeDB, we will send you an invitation to join the Group.
