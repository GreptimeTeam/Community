# GreptimeDB Community

We're excited to have you as a member of Greptime's community! GreptimeDB is a modern hybrid time series & analytical database. Whether you're a developer, architect, designer, technical writer, or just someone who's passionate about open source projects, there's a role for you in our community.

This guide assists you in getting started with our community. We kindly request that you take a few moments to read through this document and become acquainted with our code of conduct, guidelines for contributing, and where to find additional resources.

We welcome you to share your ideas, and help us build a vibrant and inclusive community.

## Governance
As GreptimeDB is still in its early stages, we have not yet established a governance system comparable to the Kubernetes Community. As of now, we are maintaining only one official group on Slack.

* **Contributor Channel** where developers and contributors communicate through text-based meetings, bi-weekly Office Hours, questionnaires, meetups, and more. We hope this group can promote collaborations and exchange ideas between Greptime's team of developers and contributors who are interested in building an amazing TSDB together!
The discussion will cover various topics, including:
  * Gathering new requirements
  * Discussing issues with GreptimeDB products
  * Sharing technical knowledge
  * Announcing the latest releases and private previews
  * Demostrating new features
  * Responding to any questions
  * And more...

To foster a respectful and inclusive community, as well as enhancing communication, we hope that every member can adhere to the guidelines and etiquette of our group discussions:

1. **Don’t add someone to a channel without letting them know**: A contributor is defined as someone who has contributed to Greptime GitHub projects. To avoid confusion, let someone know that you’ll be adding them to a channel and clarify their responsibilities beforehand.

2. **Be careful with @channel or @everyone all the time**: When you @channel, everyone who is in the channel will get a notification. With @everyone, all members of the general channel will be notified. You can prevent misunderstandings and confusion by only @mentioning or DM the people who need to see your message.

3. **Do write to be understood**: Please try to write your entire point within one message, use direct, succinct language, or bullet points and numbers given the asynchronous nature of Slack.

4. **Use threads to maintain conversation flow**: We encourage you to reply directly to topics and messages that are relevant to you by using Slack threads. Replying within a thread helps to keep the channel organized and maintain control of the workspace.

5. **Customize your Slack notifications**: As we have contributors located in different timezones, we respect everyone's work style. If you would rather not be interrupted, we kindly request that you update your status accordingly or clearly communicate your designated working hours so that others may be informed.

Once you have made a contribution to GreptimeDB, we will send you an invitation to join the Group.
